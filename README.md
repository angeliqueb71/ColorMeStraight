WebSockets are a protocol built on top of TCP. They hold the connection to the server open so that the server can send information to the client, even in the absence of a request from the client. WebSockets allow for bi-directional, "full-duplex" communication between the client and the server by creating a persistent connection between the two.

Action-Cable
it provides both a client-side JavaScript framework, and a server-side Ruby framework. And because it integrates so tightly with Rails, we have access to all of our models from within our WebSocket workers, effectively layering Action Cable on top of our existing Rails architecture, including Active Record (or any other ORM).

::before is exactly the same only it inserts the content before any other content in the HTML instead of after. The only reasons to use one over the other are:

You want the generated content to come before the element content, positionally.
::after content is also "after" in source-order, so it will position on top of ::before if stacked on top of each other naturally.
